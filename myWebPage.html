Bio:
<h3>

I am a girl who code that loves to write and create creative projects with new inspiring ideas to make into a reality in the future.

Likes: Cheese Cake, Robots, Gaming, Dancing, babies, animales, etc.
<h3>

Dislikes: Polution, Smoking, Grammer.

Everytime am feeling down, need something to distract myself or am simply board I always watch this video which keeps me smiling from ear to ear.

Something I like about winter besides the snow (Only when it's for the holiday with holiday tradition and food) is the picture of this adorable puppy as if it was snowing as I would call him my snowball or her my snowflake<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a0/f3/6f/a0f36f4c5985393acb53086b393f4c1d.jpg">
I sometimes wonder about the future for myself of what would be there for me when I grow up. I like to dream a scene or an idea whenever I hear music, look at a video, read a book or simply daydream about it.
Or just dance to the beat if I feel like doing so. Besides thinking about making robots, and making inventions in the future for helping people,
I also want to have a performance of the stories I would write come to life like acting them out instead of filming it, since it'll feel more amazing.
I also want to help people live in a heathy and safe enviorment which would be amazing to work with the police force even if I wasn't a detective.
